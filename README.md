## About

Genesis Synapse is an advanced quantitative trading platform leveraging the power of quantitative analysis. Over two years in development, Genesis Synapse presents a sophisticated suite of products that strategically span the two major sectors of algorithmic trading and quantitative research, providing a comprehensive ecosystem of products that enable the strategic development and deployment of trading strategies for a network of assets. These products cover the complete pipeline of developing and deploying advanced trading algorithms while leveraging complete automation and multi-asset trading at scale. From risk management to financial modeling, Genesis Synapse provides quantitative traders with a complete, transparent algorithmic trading environment from start to finish. A fully interactive quantitative trading platform constitutes the headliner for Generation 3 of Genesis Synapse (GS3). In addition, GS3 introduces optimized multi-asset trading support across all products, enabling developers to design and simulate the performance of an actively managed fund and trade that fund in real-time without compromising speed. GS3 brings Genesis Synapse closer than ever before to a hedge fund management tool, bridging the gap between retail investing and institutional trading.
