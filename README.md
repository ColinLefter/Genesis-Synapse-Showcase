# Genesis Synapse Showcase

## About
Genesis Synapse is an advanced quantitative trading platform leveraging the power of quantitative analysis. Over two years in development, Genesis Synapse presents a sophisticated suite of products for algorithmic trading and quantitative research. Our products strategically span the two major sectors of algorithmic trading and quantitative research, enabling us to provide a comprehensive system where each product complements another. These products are designed to cover the complete pipeline of developing and deploying advanced trading algorithms while leveraging complete automation and high-frequency trading at scale. From risk management to financial modeling, Genesis Synapse provides investors with a complete, transparent algorithmic trading environment from start to finish. A fully interactive quantitative trading platform constitutes the headliner for Generation 3 of Genesis Synapse (GS3). In addition, GS3 introduces multi-asset trading support, enabling investors to design and simulate the performance of an actively managed fund and trade that fund in real time without compromising speed. GS3 brings Genesis Synapse closer than ever before to a hedge fund management tool, bridging the gap between retail investing and institutional trading.
