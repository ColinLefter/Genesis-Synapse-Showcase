Genesis Quantitative Platforms is an algorithmic trading platform that offers data-driven infrastructure for cryptocurrency spot trading. Genesis Synapse is our flagship product that fuses quantitative analysis with algorithmic trading to provide quantitative traders with a complete end-to-end solution for developing, deploying and maintaining fully automated trading systems.

## Synapse

Over two years in development, Genesis Synapse presents a sophisticated suite of products that strategically span the two major sectors of algorithmic trading and quantitative research, providing a comprehensive ecosystem of products that enable the strategic development and deployment of trading strategies for a network of assets. These products cover the complete pipeline of developing and deploying advanced trading algorithms while leveraging complete automation and multi-asset trading at scale. From risk management to financial modelling, Genesis Synapse provides quantitative traders with a complete, transparent algorithmic trading environment from start to finish. A fully interactive quantitative trading platform constitutes the headliner for Generation 3 of Genesis Synapse (GS3). In addition, GS3 introduces optimized multi-asset trading support across all products, enabling developers to design and simulate the performance of an actively managed fund and trade that fund in real time without compromising speed. GS3 brings Genesis Synapse closer than ever before to a hedge fund management tool, bridging the gap between retail investing and institutional trading.
